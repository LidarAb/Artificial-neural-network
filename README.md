# Artificial-neural-network
Artificial neural network is a program to Handwritten digits recognition.
The program will accept an input image of a digit between 0 and 9 and will return as an output the digit that was detected.
The project include matrix class (represent the images), the hole network, each neural dense, and activation dense (where the activation function executed).
